# PIX

PIX is an initiative by the Central Bank of Brazil to modernize the country's payment system. It allows people and companies to transfer money instantly between bank accounts, without the need for intermediaries such as checks, TEDs or DOCs. To understand how PIX works, it is essential to understand the key components involved.

## Technical Components of PIX

### 1. Participants

The main participants in the PIX include:

- Central Bank: Regulates and supervises the PIX system, establishing the rules and guidelines.

- Financial Institutions: These are the banks and institutions authorized to offer PIX services to customers. This includes traditional banks, digital banks and fintechs.

- Direct Participants: These are financial institutions authorized to connect directly to the PIX system.

- Indirect Participants: These are financial institutions that connect to the PIX system via direct participants.

### 2. keys
One of the most distinctive features of PIX are the PIX keys, which allow the recipient to be identified without the need to enter account and branch numbers. PIX keys can be:

- CPF/CNPJ: The Individual or Corporate Taxpayer Registration number.

- E-mail: The recipient's e-mail address.

- Telephone number: The telephone number associated with the PIX account.

- Random key: An alphanumeric code generated by the bank.

### 3. technical infrastructure
PIX uses a technical infrastructure based on international instant payment standards. This infrastructure consists of:

- SPI (Instant Payment System): This is the central platform that allows funds to be transferred between financial institutions.

- DIR (Directory of Transactional Account Identifiers): It is a centralized registry that maps PIX keys to the corresponding account and branch information.

- STR (Reserve Transfer System): Ensures that transactions are settled efficiently and securely.


## How a Transaction Works
Now let's understand how a PIX transaction takes place from a technical point of view:

1. Initiation: The sender initiates a PIX transaction in the banking application or platform by providing the recipient's PIX key, the transaction amount and, optionally, a description.

2. Authorization: The sender's bank verifies the authenticity and availability of the funds in the sender's account.

3. Routing: Based on the recipient's PIX key, the PIX system routes the transaction to the recipient's bank.

4. Notification: The recipient's bank notifies the recipient of the transaction.

5. Confirmation: The recipient confirms the transaction, if necessary by entering their password or authenticating themselves in accordance with the bank's policies.

6. Settlement: The transaction is settled via STR and the funds are transferred instantly from the sender's account to the recipient's account.

7. Proof: Both parties involved receive proof of the transaction, including a QR code to facilitate future payments.

## PIX security
PIX is designed with several security features, including two-factor authentication, encryption and real-time monitoring to detect suspicious activity. In addition, financial institutions have a responsibility to implement additional security measures to protect their customers.

PIX represents a significant innovation in Brazil's payment system, offering a fast, secure and convenient alternative to traditional transfers. This white paper explored the key components and operation of PIX, highlighting the importance of PIX keys, technical infrastructure and security aspects. As PIX continues to evolve and gain adoption, it is crucial that financial institutions and users are aware of how to make the most of this revolutionary system.

#### Note
> Remember that PIX is constantly developing, and it is important to keep up with regulatory and technical updates to ensure the correct and safe use of this instant payment system.
